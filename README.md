Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects individuals with ovaries, leading to various health issues including infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular complications. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing symptoms and preventing long-term health risks. A machine learning model was developed using a Random Forest classifier to predict the likelihood of PCOS in patients based on a comprehensive dataset.
The dataset encompasses a range of attributes relevant to PCOS diagnosis, including age, body mass index (BMI), hormonal levels (such as HCG and progesterone), insulin resistance, menstrual cycle regularity, and other clinical parameters.
The data underwent extensive preprocessing to enhance its quality, including handling missing values and normalizing feature scales. A feature selection process identified the most significant attributes linked to PCOS, such as BMI, insulin levels, menstrual irregularities, and androgen levels. The model was trained on this optimized dataset, achieving an impressive accuracy.
This project not only provides a novel approach to PCOS prediction but also serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, enabling them to make informed and timely decisions for patient care.
